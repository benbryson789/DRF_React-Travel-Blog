        <h1>ABOUT MY BLOG</h1>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">On Travel with Deb I share my travel experience and tips, so you can get new ideas about your next vacation, travel destination or just a short weekend escape. I have travelled to over 60 countries so I think it is safe to say that everyone will find something interesting to read here. I wanted my blog to be available to as many readers as possible, so I decided to write it in English.</li>
        <h1>MY HOME COUNTRY</h1>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info">I live in the United States which is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and I feel very luch for that.</li>
        <h1>MY WORK</h1>
        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">Nope, I am not just another travel blogger who quit her job to become a “world traveler”. 
        Trust me, unless you are someone with over 1 million followers on Instagram, you cannot live normally from traveling and posting photos. Sure, you can earn some decent pocket money, but if you really want to make a living out of it, it is hard work. And I mean hard work, way over 8 hours a day.  I have a  job. Quitting my job was never an option. Mostly because I am one of those lucky bastards who can honestly say “I love my job”. </p>
        I work as a Sales Director in the company Valens where we produce top quality food supplements. I work as a Sales Director in the company Valens where we produce top quality food supplements. I strongly believe that healthy lifestyle is the key to enjoy everything else, so I will write about it occasionally in my blog. Besides keeping me fit and healthy, my job also enables me to travel on business quite a lot. I work as a Sales Director in the company Valens where we produce top quality food supplements.
